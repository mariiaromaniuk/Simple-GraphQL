## Why To Use GraphQL  
- RESTful APIs often deliver too much information thatâ€™s unneeded for a given request. GraphQL is a protocol in the form of a data-querying language for your API, where you can ask for what you need, get exactly that. Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because they control the data they get, not the server.
- You can get many resources in a single request. GraphQL queries access not just the properties of one resource but also smoothly follow references between them. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request. Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.
- Great developer tools - you know exactly what data you can request from your API without leaving your editor, highlight potential issues before sending a query.
It is a layer that sits on top of your server and interfaces with both the server and the client.
